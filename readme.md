# BACKEND DEVELOPMENT WITH SQL DATABASE

*  This is an assignment where I have imported a CSV file with stocks of various companies into a database in MySQL and then give the endpoints with user-specific data. 

*  In this assignment we have stored the .csv file in a database called "data" and we are using express.js framework to build RESTful API's with node.js.

*  We are also using "mysql2" for using MySQL queries.

* We will be using "createPool" method in order to get the MySQL details and using "promise()" methods also.

* We will create functions for various endpoints in the file "index.js" and we will use that functions to various endpoints in "app.js".
